However, most of the current job schedulers do not consider job-specific characteristics such as communication patterns during resource allocation. This often leads to sub-optimal node allocations. We propose three node allocation algorithms that consider the jobâ€™s communication behavior to improve the performance of communication-intensive jobs. We develop our algorithms for tree-based network topologies. The proposed algorithms aim at minimizing network contention by allocating nodes on the least contended switches. We also show that allocating nodes in powers of two leads to a decrease in inter-switch communication for MPI communications, which further improves performance. We implement and evaluate our algorithms using SLURM, a widely-used and well-known job scheduler. We show that the proposed algorithms can reduce the execution times of communication-intensive jobs by 9% (326 hours) on average. The average wait time of jobs is reducedby 31% across three supercomputer job logs.","tags":null,"title":"Communication-aware Job Scheduling using SLURM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Priya Mishra","Denis Trystram"],"categories":null,"content":"In this work, we collaborated with Qarnot, a green cloud computing company, to design an energy disaggregation algorithm for their smart buildings. The Qarnot Computing platform uses computing-heaters and utilizes the waste heat from IT computations in their buidings and offices. Through energy disaggregation, our aim was to better understand the energy requirements at different locations of the building and hence, forecast energy needs. Using this information, we can achieve a more efficient job scheduling, for example, scheduling more jobs where there is greater energy requirement.

More specifically, we consider the problem of scheduling a set of independent jobs whose processing times are unknown. User runtimes are known to be highly inaccurate. Scheduling policies such as backfilling or shortest job first rely on these estimates to schedule jobs. In this work, we explore the use of machine learning methods to provide better estimates for the exceution times using user history and job characteristics. Instead of estimating the exact value of the job runtime, we consider that the jobs fall in two categories \u0026ndash; short and long jobs and predict the type of each job. We used several classification models as well as simpler schemes such as predicting based on the class of previously submitted jobs alone. We evaluated our models using several full workload traces.\n","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"95c8102ff5a1330a14ec7165c72ebca5","permalink":"https://priya2698.github.io/project/improving-scheduling-using-job-runtime-predictions/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/improving-scheduling-using-job-runtime-predictions/","section":"project","summary":"In this work, we were interested in studying the impact of job runtime estimates on the performance of non-clairoyant scheduling algorithms.

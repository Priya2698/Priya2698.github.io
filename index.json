However, most of the current job schedulersdo not consider job-specific characteristics such as communicationpatterns during resource allocation. This often leads to sub-optimalnode allocations. We propose three node allocation algorithms thatconsider the jobâ€™s communication behavior to improve the perfor-mance of communication-intensive jobs. We develop our algorithmsfor tree-based network topologies. The proposed algorithms aim atminimizing network contention by allocating nodes on the leastcontended switches. We also show that allocating nodes in powersof two leads to a decrease in inter-switch communication for MPIcommunications, which further improves performance. We imple-ment and evaluate our algorithms using SLURM, a widely-used andwell-known job scheduler. We show that the proposed algorithmscan reduce the execution times of communication-intensive jobs by9% (326 hours) on average. The average wait time of jobs is reducedby 31% across three supercomputer job logs.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Communication-aware Job Scheduling using SLURM","type":"publication"}]
